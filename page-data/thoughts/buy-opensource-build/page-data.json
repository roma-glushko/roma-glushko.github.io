It wouldn't make much sense for us to rebuild our deployment tools as it's far from our main competency.\n\nOne way or another, it will **require you a decent amount of resources to complete, some product research and a solid engineering team to design and implement it right**. \nNot to mention all disadvantages of the open source strategy like **hosting, upgrades, and scaling**. Those are on you, but you are pretty much in **full control of what it looks like** since you are designing it.\n\n**The build strategy has the biggest scope** among the rest, this is why it's recommended to go with it only when you have solid reasons to cross out the first two strategies.\n\nInterestingly, engineering-minded people tend to think about the build strategy first and pick it to follow frequently. \nThat might be explained by the \"when you have a hammer, everything else looks like a nail\" saying and that's really a tricky path.\nYou may end up on your **own technical island** where you have custom exotic tooling, no one else uses or has experience working with, with limited support, usability, reliability, etc. \nEffectively, you would be unconnected from the rest of the \"civilization\" that uses established industry standards.\nThey are not going to get better or adapt to your growing needs overnight unless you invest a good amount of time into it. \nNow imagine having such projects in some critical flows of the company, and you will know how come some companies stagnate.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition note\">\n    <p class=\"admonition-title\">Takeaway</p>\n    <p class=\"admonition-body\">\n    Don't create in-house projects that you won't be able to support long-term. \n    You won't be able to support them unless they are tightly connected to your business offering.\n    Otherwise, the ramification of having unsupported in-house legacy solutions could drastically kill your agility.\n    </p>\n</aside>\n\nEven if the problem is from your core business, you may not want to jump straight into building a solution yourself.\nA great alternative approach would be to **start quick and small by leveraging the existing solutions** (either to buy XaaS or find an open source project) and hack an MVP around that.\nThen, you can give it some time to be tried by real users and wait for their feedback. \nSuch testing could bring important validation for the idea and shape your long-term solution that you can decide to build yourself.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nStart solving your problem in quickest and easiest way possible like buying XaaS or leveraging OSS, obtain more information and \ncontext about your problem space and only then allow yourself to move with more involved strategies like rebuilding it yourself. \n\nOur world has never moved forward faster, so by the time you would come to more time-consuming solution, \nthe problem could become outdated or new ways of solving it could become available. That's why agility is the treasure we could not allow ourselves to lose.\n","wordCount":{"words":1643},"frontmatter":{"id":null,"path":"/thoughts/buy-opensource-build/","humanDate":"Jul 10, 2023","fullDate":"2023-07-10","title":"Buy, Open Source, Build","keywords":["strategy"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/204db/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/7284f/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.jpg 750w,\n/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/fb319/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.jpg 1080w,\n/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/c8896/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.jpg 1366w,\n/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/204db/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/57584/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.webp 750w,\n/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/72f43/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.webp 1080w,\n/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/4a276/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.webp 1366w,\n/static/d4faf7f0e7d069e71ce8d39c6f85e36f/2136b/frankie-lopez-Jd_7HTsjhLw-unsplash.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6671874999999999}}},"coverCredits":"Photo by Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@frankielopez\">Frankie Lopez</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/feedback\">Unsplash</a>"}}},"pageContext":{"nextThought":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/thoughts/promotion-paradoxes/","title":"Promotion Paradoxes"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1271460761","2758069760"]}
