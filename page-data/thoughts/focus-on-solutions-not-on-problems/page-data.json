This world is full of problems, but you don't notice that because you too focus on your problems.</p>\n<p>I will tell you even more: everyone hates people that focus on problems. They are usually spreading a way more negative emotions, then others.</p>\n<p>Don't focus on problems, focus on solutions.</p>\n<p>Whenever you are, you should try to find a solution. Don't spend too much time asking \"why this happened to me?\" and \"why my life is so hard?\". These are the wrong questions.</p>\n<p>You better ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"What can I do to change things?\"</li>\n<li>\"How can I fix the situation?\"</li>\n<li>\"How can I avoid the situation in the future?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because your goal is not to comply. Your goal is to be in a better position then you are right now.
