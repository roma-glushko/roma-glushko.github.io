## Notebook File

What you have seen in the Jupyter UI is stored a notebook file with the `ipynb` extension. The notebook file is a JSON file with a [well-defined structure](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/nbformat.html) like this:

```json {4-21,23-42}
{
 "nbformat": 4,
 "nbformat_minor": 5,
 "metadata": {
  "kernelspec": {
   "display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)",
   "language": "python",
   "name": "python3"
  },
  "language_info": {
   "codemirror_mode": {
    "name": "ipython",
    "version": 3
   },
   "file_extension": ".py",
   "mimetype": "text/x-python",
   "name": "python",
   "nbconvert_exporter": "python",
   "pygments_lexer": "ipython3",
   "version": "3.11.3"
  }
 },
 "cells": [
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": 3,
   "id": "bbc4a98a-5d22-4d84-ab16-526e7dab0984",
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [
    {
     "name": "stdout",
     "output_type": "stream",
     "text": [
      "Hey dudes ðŸ‘‹\n"
     ]
    }
   ],
   "source": [
    "print(\"Hey dudes ðŸ‘‹\")"
   ]
  },
 ],
}
```

The notebook file has versioning via `nbformat.nbformat_minor{:.entity.name.function}` attributes. 

The main part of the document is the `cells{:.entity.name.function}` array. It actually contains source code and the corresponding output of all cells in the notebook. 
Hence, the notebook is like a snapshot of what you have done in the Jupyter UI. You can save it and share with other people like a report without a need to rerun all the stuff to fully read it.

The notebook format also contains extensible points in a form of `metadata{:.entity.name.function}` properties on the whole notebook, cell, and output levels. It's a simple key-value maps where other plugins could store additional information if needed.
