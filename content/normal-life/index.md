How do you imagine a normal life?

It's like driving a comfortable car. You are going well. The weather outside is shining.
You feel calm and everything seems to be under the control. You are driving toward your goals and plans.
Nothing stops you!

Have you ever considered roadblocks, car incidents or getting lost as a part of a normal life?

Well, you should, because this is how real life looks like. There are no reasons to dream about something else which never happens.
