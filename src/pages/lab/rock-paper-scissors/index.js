             <p><strong>Rock, paper, scissors</strong> is a legendary hand game that many of us played with friends in childhood.</p>
             <p>
                Rules are simple. You and your opponent choose one of three shapes (<span aria-label="rock figure" role="img">✊</span>, <span aria-label="paper figure" role="img">✋</span>, <span aria-label="scissors figure" role="img">✌️</span>), which you both form simultaneously.
                Your goal is to guess a shape that beats your opponent's choice:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Rock beats Scissors (<span aria-label="rock figure" role="img">✊</span> → <span aria-label="beats scissors figure" role="img">✌️</span>)</li>
                <li>Paper covers Rock (<span aria-label="paper figure" role="img">✋</span> → <span aria-label="beats rock figure" role="img">✊</span>)</li>
                <li>Scissors cuts Paper (<span aria-label="scissors figure" role="img">✌️</span> → <span aria-label="beats paper figure" role="img">✋</span>)</li>
              </ul> 
              <p>
                Now you have a chance to try to play rock, paper, scissors in an AI-powered game online.
              </p>
              <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
              <p>
                The game requests your web camera access and loads a computer vision model directly into your browser (the game is completely serverless). 
              </p>
              <p>
                When you press the play button, you have 3 seconds to form one of three choices and to show it on camera. 
                The model will try to predict what form you showed and compare it with another choice which computer simultaneously made with you.
                The game compares both choices and updates your scores.
              </p>
              <p>Try to play until you win!</p>
