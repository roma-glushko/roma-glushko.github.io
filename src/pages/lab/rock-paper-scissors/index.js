             <p><strong>Rock, paper, scissors</strong> is a legendary hand game that many of us played with friends in the childhood.</p>
             <p>
                Rules are simple. You and your opponent choose one of three shapes (<span role="img">✊</span>, <span role="img">✋</span>, <span role="img">✌️</span>), which you both form simultaneously.
                Your goal is to guess a shape that beats your opponent's choice:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Rock beats Scissors (<span role="img">✊</span> → <span role="img">✌️</span>)</li>
                <li>Paper covers Rock (<span role="img">✋</span> → <span role="img">✊</span>)</li>
                <li>Scissors cuts Paper (<span role="img">✌️</span> → <span role="img">✋</span>)</li>
              </ul> 
              <p>
                Now you have a chance to try to play rock, paper, scissors in an AI-powered game online.
              </p>
              <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
              <p>
                The game requests your web camera access and load a computer vision model directly into your browser (the game is completely serverless). 
              </p>
              <p>
                When you press the play button, you have 3 seconds to form one of three choices and to show it on camera. 
                The model will try to predict what form you showed and compare with another choice which computer simultaneously made with you.
                The game compares both choices and updates your scores.
              </p>
              <p>Try to play until you win!</p>
